# Mecca Landmark Recognition

  The research intends to build two models using three approaches: image detection, Chatbot, and Speech recognition, which are employed and connected in the website. 
## Landmark image dataset

  The image dataset was manually collected by the researchers from different sources which are visiting the landmarks and capture it and some online open sources. 
  The dataset contains images 981 images of six landmarks include Kaaba, Al-Safa and Marwah, Maqam Ibrahim, Clock tower, Alnoor Mountain and Altaneem Mosque.

### Image recognition models
    - InceptionV3
    - MobileNet2

## Chatbot Text dataset

  The chatbot text-dataset is collected through multi-websites which provide textual information related to Makkah historical places. The data contains text information about Makkah landmarks and famous sights. 
 
 ### Chatbot models
    Chatbot was built based on the type of retrieval chatbot. 
    This type is basically trained to provide the best possible response from a database of predefined responses, 
    where these responses are existing information.
    
### Website:
  The image classification model and the chatbot model were deployed into a website using the Flask framework.   The web pages were designed using simple HTML and CSS.
